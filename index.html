            <p>My humble experience with designing and developing websites is not that much but I’m a versatile person as I recently graduated from the faculty of computer science, at Sinai University with a GPA (B+) but I’ve had a bunch of voluntary experience
                joining well-known organizations such as Google developers group, Enactus, Rotaract and many more. That's why after graduation, I applied for Mearn Stack Track (Intensive Code Camp) sponsored by the Information Technology Institute (ITI)
                which helped me kickstart my web development career using the latest technology stacks and frameworks like React and Angular and also working with project management tools like Trello for the graduation project.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> So, after graduating from ITI, I decide to have a deeper technical background in web development, especially Mern stack, which is why I'm having a frontend diploma at Route Academy while also trying to apply for internships to increase my
                experience.

            <p> You can visit my <a href="https://github.com/RaheemAmer">Github</a>to check my progress there, I'm trying to document my way to land my first job while also helping anyone to learn from my mistakes.
